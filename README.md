Want to add some automation scripting to your OpenNMS Installation?


First off, this is for Debian based installations when the repos are being used for opennms and postgres 10 installation.
If you haven't held your packages from being updated, you will want to do this so the next upgrade doesn't break your existing installation.
Migrations/Upgrades is not a perfect process with OpenNMS. These scripts will help you automate server management tasks without breaking your installation.
